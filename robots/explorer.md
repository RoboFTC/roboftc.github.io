# Explorer (Astra Machina – FTC 16010) | Kuek - 16010

This is the CAD for **Explorer**, built by **FTC Team 16010 Astra Machina** during the 2025–2026 *DECODE* season. The full robot is viewable and downloadable in the link Fusion published below.

## Drivetrain

This robot's drivetrain features a standard parallel plate drivetrain with a dead-axle design for high power efficiency along with the drivetrain being geared up on a 312 RPM (24:18) ratio for the perfect balance of both speed and torque for this season's game.

## Intake

This robot features a 3-stages of compliant wheels to intake balls into the robot with multiple color sensors in the back use to detect when the ball is readily in place and good to shoot using a kicker arm powered by an Axon servo for controlled scoring.

This is all powered by a single GoBilda Yellow Jacket 435 RPM motor geared with a 14T to 10T ratio for a good balance of torque and speed to quickly intake artifacts off the field and hold them in place.

## Shooter + Turret

This robot's shooter features an FRC-inspired flywheel along with an included counter roller to negate any spin on the artifacts when launched to reduce bounce outs from the goal. This is all powered by 2 5000 Series GoBilda 6000 RPM motors.

This robot's turret is mounted onto an off-the-shelf Lazy Susan available on Amazon with custom M6 threads for easy mounting and replacability. This is all powered by a 435 RPM motor on a 16T to 84T ratio for quick adjustments needed during the match when scoring artifacts while encountering defence.

## Advantages

- Power-efficient dead-axle PPDT Design
- Quick intake pick ups and consistent transfer.
- Consistent shooting from all areas of field
