# Astra Machina Ri3D | Kuek - 16010

This is the CAD for RI3D from the FTC Team 1610, Astra Machina for the 2025-2026 FTC Robotics Season, DECODE, available as a Fusion Link.

This robot is meant to give many new rookies and existing teams ideas this season, or seasons beyond, on some ideas you can create or replicate with your robot.

## Drivetrain

This robot features a relatively small drivetrain with a size of 15 inches by 14 inches. It features a centralized motor design with dead axle powered wheels. It also utilizes a dual dead wheel design to aid with localization during the autonomous period.

## Shooter

The shooter features a shooter design commonly used in the FRC 2017 Season, Steamworks, with a fixed angle flywheel shooter. It is powered by 2 5000 Series Gobilda 6000 RPM motors and is driven by chain so that multiple ratios can be chosen to see how much wind-up time and power is needed.

## Intake

The intake features 2 sets of 96mm Gobilda Bootwheels to propel the artifact into the flywheel shooter. It also features a low angle ramp on the bottom of the chassis to help elavate the artifacts from the ground to the opening of the shooter. It also features HTD5 belts connecting the system powered by an 1150 RPM GoBilda Yellow Jacket Motor.

## Advantages
- Small form factor (15 in. x 14 in.)
- Simple power transmission throughout the design (Shooter, Intake, Drivetrain)
- Simple, yet effective design
